# RBL
RTOS Basic Layer
This project's idea comes from rblos.
The purpose is to build up a platform layer up to SOC baremental software or any RTOS/Linux.
Any embedded software based on RBL can be easily ported and tested in windows or Linux envionment.
This project will be managed by git. While RBLOS's version is managed by directory. 
This is the difference between RBL and RBLOS
